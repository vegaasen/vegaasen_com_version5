vegaasen_com_version5
=====================

# Information 

Version 5 of my homepage. The plan _this_ time is to make everything as lightweight as possible. There will be no Wordpress integration or anything.
I will include a link to my blog etc, but thats it - as the blog is not actually a blog - more like a .. um, well place to make notez. 
^-- the blog will most likely change as well, as I dont see the point of it :-P

## Performance

These are the requirements that I strive to apply:

* < 80kb
* no pointless large js frameworks
* minified all kinds of stuff

# IDE

* vim
* sublime 2

# Technologies

* nodejs
* less
* html5
* css3
* homebrew
* some JS-framework..if needed at all..?
* grunt to minify
* jsTestDriver for the test-framework
