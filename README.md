=====================

# Information

Version 5 of my homepage. The plan _this_ time is to make everything as lightweight as possible. There will be no Wordpress integration or anything.
I will include a link to my blog etc, but thats it - as the blog is not actually a blog - more like a .. um, well place to make notez.
^-- the blog will most likely change as well, as I dont see the point of it :-P

## Performance

These are the requirements that I strive to apply:

* < 80kb
* no pointless large js frameworks
* minified all kinds of stuff

# Generating images

Do the following to generate images:

# Working with the code

This stuff uses Grunt in order to compile the less sources and uglify the scripts on the fly. Just do the following in order to make stuff work out of the box:

  grunt

Thats it :-) Then you can open browser at the desired location, and you're set!

Note that Grunt will as default tasks compile the less and js-files for the first time

# IDE

* vim
* atom

# Technologies

* nodejs
* less
* uglify
* html5
* css3
* homebrew
* some JS-framework..if needed at all..?
* grunt to minify and compile the less stuff
* jsTestDriver for the test-framework
